        <h2>Discription</h2>
        <p>Introducing our treasured family recipe for authentic Chicken Dum Biryani! 
            Aromatic long-grain rice, perfectly layered over succulent chicken marinated in a blend of earthy, 
            aromatic spices, garnished with caramelized onions and delicate strands of saffron.
             Each bite bursts with the vibrant flavors of India.</p>
         <h2>Ingrediants</h2> 
         <ul>
            <li>Basmati Rice -Long-grain basmati rice is traditionally used to make biryani. I prefer the Kohinoor brand extra-long grain basmati rice, which is easily available at Indian grocery stores.</li>
            <li>Chicken - Traditionally, whole bone-in chicken pieces are used to make biryani. Here in the US, it can be tough to find a whole chicken that's properly cut for biryani. As a handy shortcut, I like to use a mix of bone-in drumsticks and boneless chicken thighs. This way, you still get those authentic flavors and tender, juicy meat!</li>
            <li>Whole Spices - shahi jeera, bay leaves, star anise, cloves, and green cardamom pods. A classic combination of spices to infuse the rice with rich flavor. Read more about each of these spices in my Essential Indian Spice Guide.</li>
            <li>Ground Spices - turmeric, Kashmiri red chili powder, Biryani Masala. Garam masala can be used in a pinch in place of Biryani Masala.</li>
            <li>Yellow Onion - thinly sliced yellow onion caramelized in ghee makes for the signature Birista onions that are a must in the marinade as well as for topping. With a rich golden color, they add a sweet, caramelized flavor to complement all the spices. Although these onions are traditionally deep fried I also have an air fryer fried onions recipe.</li>
            <li>Ghee - homemade ghee helps bring authentic taste and aromas to Biryani and I highly recommend using ghee instead of oil when making Biryani.</li>
            <li>Herbs - fresh mint and cilantro add a perfect combination of herbs for cool, citrusy flavors and a pop of color.</li>
         </ul>  
         <h2>Steps</h2> 
         <ol>
            <li>Make the marinade by mixing yogurt, ginger, garlic, turmeric, red chili powder, garam masala, salt, mint leaves, and lemon juice.
            <li>Add chicken and coat evenly with the marinade. Keep in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. You can marinate the chicken overnight too.
            <li>While the chicken is marinating, rinse and drain the rice 2 to 3 times, then soak in water for 20 minutes.
         </ol>
