        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This chicken fried rice will easily become one of your go-to dinners! It’s easy, it calls for basic ingredients, it’s hearty and filling and it’s perfectly flavorful.

            Plus it’s quick to make and clean up is a breeze. It also makes perfectly delicious leftovers if you are lucky enough to have any left, or make it ahead for meal prep for the next couple of days.</p>
        <h2>Ingrediants</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Brown rice – leftover rice from the day before works best. White rice will work great here too.</li>
            <li>Chicken breasts – I like to dice the chicken into very small pieces about 1/2 – 3/4-inch, it makes it the perfect size for this fried rice.</li>
            <li>Toasted sesame oil – this oil is very strong and a little goes a long way. This ingredient adds lots of flavor to this dish.</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil (or canola oil) – this is used for sautéing (along with the sesame oil so you won’t use to much of that and sesame oil on it’s own has a low smoke point).</li>
            <li>Frozen peas and carrots blend – I like to use the frozen vegetable here to save time, but fresh will work too you’ll just have to  longer so they’ll become tender enough.</li>
            <li>Green onions – feel free to add more green onions to taste.</li>
            <li>Garlic – only use fresh garlic here for best flavor.</li>
            <li>Eggs – you can add 3 eggs here to stretch the recipe a bit. If it’s easier for you, you can stir in a bowl with a fork first then add to the skillet.</li>
            <li>Low-sodium soy sauce – if you have regular sodium soy sauce that will work too, just start with 2 Tbsp and add more if needed.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large non-stick wok or skillet, heat 1 1/2 tsp sesame oil and 1 1/2 tsp of the canola oil over medium-high heat.</li>
