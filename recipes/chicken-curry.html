        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This Indian-inspired creamy chicken curry recipe is similar to a curry I had in India. The aromatic spices and flavors are a delight to the senses! Delicious with fresh naan and basmati rice.</p>
        <h2>Ingrediants</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Chicken: In our video, we use boneless, skinless chicken thighs, but chicken breasts or bone-in pieces work just as well. If you choose bone-in pieces, the simmer time should still be enough to cook the chicken. You can always add 5 to 10 minutes if it needs longer.</li>
            <li>Spices: We marinate our chicken in a mixture of salt, cumin, coriander, turmeric, black pepper, and cayenne. While 20 minutes is sufficient, you can let the chicken sit with the spices in the fridge for up to 24 hours. We call for ground spices in the recipe since that’s what most of us have available. If you have whole spices, simply grind them using a spice grinder or small coffee grinder before adding them.</li>
            <li>Onion, Garlic, and Ginger: One of our favorite tricks learned from Indian cuisine is to puree fresh garlic, ginger, onion, and water before cooking the puree in oil or ghee. This flavorful base adds so much to our chicken curry. We don’t recommend swapping the fresh garlic and ginger for dried in this recipe. Fresh ginger lasts at least a week in the fridge so don't worry about wasting it. We love to juice leftover ginger (like in these ginger shots) or use it to make this spicy garlic ginger edamame!</li>
            <li>Oil or Ghee: We prefer the flavor of ghee in this curry, but you can use oil if that’s what you have. Ghee is a clarified butter with a higher smoke point and shelf life, adding a lovely toasted butter flavor.</li>
            <li>Tomato Paste: Tomato paste adds a rich flavor to our curry. We love using the double-concentrated tubes because you can save any leftovers for another recipe.</li>
            <li>Yogurt and Cream: Don’t lighten up this curry with lower-fat options! Plain whole milk yogurt and heavy cream make this sauce rich and mouth-watering. The yogurt helps tenderize the chicken, and the cream balances all the spices.</li>
            <li>Garam Masala: Some of the most delicious curry recipes we’ve tried, stir in Garam Masala in the last few minutes of cooking to preserve its aroma and flavor. We do the same in our chicken curry, adding it with the cream during the final 5 minutes. Garam Masala is a warm, sweet Indian spice blend that differs regionally and from home to home. I have a few in my spice cabinet!</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>You’ll start by marinating the chicken with our spices. As mentioned above, 20 minutes is plenty, but you can do this up to 24 hours in advance (keep your chicken covered and in the fridge).</li>
            <li>When ready to make the curry, puree the onion, garlic, and ginger in a food processor or blender. This aromatic paste will become the base of our delicious curry and help thicken it.</li>
            <li>Brown your chicken in oil or ghee, and add the onion ginger puree. You’ll stir in more spices, tomato paste, and yogurt when the water evaporates. I add my yogurt a tablespoon at a time to prevent it from separating. (Using full-fat yogurt also helps to prevent curdling.)</li>
            <li>Simmer for 20 minutes, and then stir in Garam Masala and cream. Give it 5 minutes, then serve over rice or with some naan or homemade flatbread. For more curry recipes, try our coconut ginger vegetable curry.</li>
